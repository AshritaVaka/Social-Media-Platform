## Introduction

This project is an extensive exercise designed to showcase my proficiency in Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles using Java. The focus is on building a robust backend system that handles user authentication, data persistence, and CRUD operations for posts and comments.

We attempted to replicate a social media platform similar to Twitter, focusing on key features such as user authentication, post creation, comment handling, and user feed management.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and signup endpoints.
- **User Management**: Retrieve detailed information about users.
- **Post Management**: Create, retrieve, edit, and delete posts.
- **Comment Management**: Create, retrieve, edit, and delete comments.
- **User Feed**: Retrieve all posts by all users in reverse chronological order.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Ensures smooth user experience with meaningful error messages.

## Setup

- **Clone the Repository**:git clone https://github.com/yourusername/oop-assignment.git
cd oop-assignment
- **Build the Project**:./gradlew build
- **Run  the Application**:./gradlew bootRun
- **Access the Appliation**:The application will be running on http://localhost:8080

## Technologies Used

- **Java**:The primary programming language used for development.
- **Spring Boot**:To simplify the creation of RESTful web services.
- **H2 Database**:For in-memory database operations.
- **Postman**:For Testing the application.


# Conclusion
-This project is a comprehensive demonstration of my ability to apply object-oriented 
 programming concepts in Java. It involves creating a complex system with multiple endpoints 
 that handle user authentication, post management, and comment management, showcasing my proficiency in building and managing a robust backend system.
